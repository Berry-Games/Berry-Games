Hello,

My name is Strawberry (pseudonym). I don't have any programming background, and I am interested in creating video games. So I am currently learning C++, Pixel art , Reylib to create the game.

My page will have all the exercise projects i am going to do while learning C# and my future game as well. I am new to C# and github, so I apologize for any mistake I am gonna make in the future. Any suggestions or advice is welcome.

As of September 2024 my C# journey begins.
